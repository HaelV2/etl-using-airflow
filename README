API ETL Process using Apache Airflow
Overview
This Apache Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is designed to perform an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. It fetches data from a random user API, extracts specific fields from the API response, and loads them into a PostgreSQL database. below i will explain the key components and the purpose of this code.

Code Structure
The code is organized into several functions and a DAG definition:

Importing Necessary Libraries: In this section, i imported the required Python libraries such as airflow, requests, pandas, and sqlalchemy. These libraries are essential for handling API requests, data processing, and database interactions.

Default Arguments for the DAG: This section defines default parameters for the DAG, including the owner's name (myself), retry settings, and start date.

Functions:

get_api_data(url): Fetches data from the specified API URL and handles potential errors.
extract_data(data): Extracts specific fields from the API response.
create_data_frame(data, street_name): Creates a Pandas DataFrame from the extracted data.
load_data(user_df, table_name, connection): Loads the DataFrame into a PostgreSQL database.
run_api_processing(url, engine, **kwargs): Orchestrates the entire ETL process by calling the above functions.
Variables:

url: The URL of the random user API from which data is fetched.
engine: The SQLAlchemy database engine for PostgreSQL, which is configured to connect to my database.
Creating DAG: The code defines an Apache Airflow DAG named 'api_etl_process'. This DAG is scheduled to run daily and contains a single task ('api_etl_process_task') that executes the run_api_processing function with the specified URL and database engine.

Why This Code?
This code serves the following purposes:

Data Extraction: It retrieves data from a random user API, which can be useful for generating test data or for various data analysis and processing tasks.

Data Transformation: The code extracts specific fields from the API response and structures them into a Pandas DataFrame. This step enables data cleaning and preparation for analysis.

Data Loading: The extracted and transformed data is loaded into a PostgreSQL database. This database can serve as a persistent storage solution for the collected data.

Automation: The code is designed to be scheduled and executed automatically using Apache Airflow. This automation ensures that the ETL process runs at specified intervals without manual intervention.

Prerequisites
Before using this code, i ensured i had the following prerequisites:

Python 3.x
Apache Airflow installed and configured
Required Python libraries: requests, pandas, sqlalchemy
A PostgreSQL database with appropriate access and a table named 'user_data' (You should configure the database connection details in the code.)

Usage
To use this code:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Update the database connection details in the code to match your PostgreSQL setup.
Install the required Python libraries if they are not already installed (pip install requests pandas sqlalchemy).
Create a new DAG in your Apache Airflow instance.
Copy the code from api_etl_process.py and paste it into your DAG file.
Adjust the url variable to specify the API you want to extract data from.
Schedule the DAG according to your requirements (e.g., daily).
